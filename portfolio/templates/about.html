        Hello there! I'm Raj Sudharshan, a software developer who enjoys
        creating cutting-edge solutions that thrive on the web. My journey into
        programming began with Python and the Django framework, a path that
        ignited my passion for modern programming languages and technologies.
        <br />
        <br />

        Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working in diverse
        environments, from bustling global corporations to agile start-ups, and
        I've "checkmated" my fair share of bugs along the way. This journey has
        enabled me to hone my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, all
        while delivering value for clients. 
        <br />
        <br />

        Outside of the tech realm, I'm a national chess player with a strategic
        mindset. I tend to see parallels between chess and coding - both require
        foresight, strategy, and sometimes, a bit of creativity to outsmart the
        opponent or bug.

        Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
